# Red-Alert-Unplugged

Good day, Commander, and welcome to the hub of Red Alert Unplugged, or uRA, a game and
mod based off the OpenRA engine!

In a nutshell, as a mod RA Unplugged reaps the feature benefits of its parent project
development, OpenRA, with the opportunity of promoting features and reach towards goals
primarily for its own benefit, as opposed to being a modder friendly developer platform.
